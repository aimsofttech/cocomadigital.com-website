## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

### Issue: Phase 1 LCP not improving

```
Check:
1. Did you import lcpMonitor in App.jsx?
2. Is lcpMonitor.init() being called?
3. Are preload links in index.html correct?
4. Check Network tab for hero image loading
5. Run: window.getLCPMetrics() in console

Solution:
→ Verify all 3 files modified correctly
→ Restart npm start
→ Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
→ Check for console errors
```

### Issue: Hero image not loading in Phase 2

```
Check:
1. Are 8 image files created?
2. Are files in correct location: /public/Images/home/?
3. Are filenames exactly right?
4. Are file sizes reasonable (< 200KB each)?
5. Check Network tab for 404 errors

Solution:
→ Verify file existence: dir public/Images/home/
→ Check file permissions
→ Ensure WebP/JPEG both created
→ Verify quality settings (not too low)
```

### Issue: Phase 3 doesn't help LCP

```
Check:
1. Is DEFAULT_HERO_DATA defined?
2. Is useState initialized with DEFAULT_HERO_DATA?
3. Does hero render immediately on load?
4. Check React DevTools component tree

Solution:
→ Verify Home.jsx changes applied
→ Check console for errors
→ Verify Section01 renders with default data
→ API should still load in background
```

### Issue: GA4 events not sending (Phase 4)

```
Check:
1. Is GA4 ID configured in HTML?
2. Is gtag loaded on page?
3. Does lcpMonitor.js have GA4 code?
4. Check Network tab for google-analytics requests

Solution:
→ Verify GA4 ID in index.html
→ Check browser console for gtag
→ Verify lcpMonitor GA4 integration
→ Wait 1+ hour for GA4 to process
```

### Issue: LCP not improving after Phase 5

```
Check:
1. Are cache headers being sent?
   curl -i https://your-domain.com | grep cache-control
2. Is gzip compression active?
   curl -i https://your-domain.com | grep content-encoding
3. Is nginx config loaded?
   docker exec container nginx -t
4. Check TTFB (Time to First Byte)

Solution:
→ Verify nginx config syntax
→ Restart nginx/container
→ Check CDN caching headers
→ Review server logs for errors
→ May be server-side issue (Phase 5 covers this)
```
