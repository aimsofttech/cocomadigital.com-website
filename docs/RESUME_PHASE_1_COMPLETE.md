## 🚀 NEXT: RUN LIGHTHOUSE TEST NOW

### Why Now?

- ✅ FCP error is resolved
- ✅ Page renders properly
- ✅ Images load without errors
- ✅ Ready to measure actual performance

### How to Test (3 Steps)

#### Step 1: Open Page

```
Go to: http://localhost:3000
Look for: Hero image with "Cocoma Digital" text
Expect: Page loads, image visible, no errors
```

#### Step 2: Run Lighthouse

```
Press F12 (open DevTools)
Click Lighthouse tab
Select: Mobile (for mobile optimization)
Click: [Analyze page load]
Keep browser window active and visible
Wait: 60-90 seconds
```

#### Step 3: Check Results

```
Expected to see:
✅ First Contentful Paint (FCP): ~1.2s
✅ Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): ~3.5s
✅ Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): 0.05
✅ Performance Score: 75+

NOT expecting to see:
❌ "NO_FCP" error
❌ 404 errors
❌ Red "Failed" audits
```
