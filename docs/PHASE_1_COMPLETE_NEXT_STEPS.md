## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Action 1: Verify Phase 1 Works (5-10 min)

```powershell
# Terminal:
npm start

# Browser:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12 → Console tab
3. Wait 5-7 seconds
4. See: "📈 LCP Metrics:" with your metrics
```

### Action 2: Run Lighthouse (10 min)

```
1. DevTools → Lighthouse tab
2. Select "Mobile"
3. Click "Analyze page load"
4. Look for LCP: Should show ~5,500ms
5. Take screenshot for tracking
```

### Action 3: Start Phase 2 (1-2 days)

```
Read: PHASE_2_IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION.md
Task: Create 8 image variants using Squoosh.app
Time: 2-3 hours total
Expected: LCP ~3,500ms (64% total improvement)
```

---

## 📋 Phase 2 Quick Start (Do This Next)

### Step 1: Go to Squoosh (Online Tool - Easiest)

```
URL: https://squoosh.app
What: Free online image optimizer
Time: 30 seconds to reach site
No Installation: Browser-based, instant
```

### Step 2: Create Image Variants

```
For each size (480, 768, 1200, 1600):
1. Drag your hero banner image
2. Resize to width
3. Export as WebP
4. Export as JPEG
5. Repeat 4 times → 8 total images

Expected: 2-3 hours total
Result: Hero-banner-{size}.{webp,jpg}
```

### Step 3: Place Files

```
Destination: /public/Images/home/
├── hero-banner-sm.webp
├── hero-banner-md.webp
├── hero-banner-lg.webp
├── hero-banner-xl.webp
├── hero-banner-sm.jpg
├── hero-banner-md.jpg
├── hero-banner-lg.jpg
└── hero-banner-xl.jpg
```

### Step 4: Test & Verify

```
1. npm start
2. Check Network tab
3. Should load appropriate size
4. Run Lighthouse → LCP should be ~3,500ms
```
