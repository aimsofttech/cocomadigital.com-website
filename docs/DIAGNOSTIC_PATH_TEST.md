# üîç DIAGNOSTIC PATH TEST - Finding Correct Image Path

## Problem

Image file EXISTS (838KB) but browser shows "IMAGE LOAD ERROR"

## File Location (Verified)

```
‚úÖ C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\cocomadigital.com-anshu-new\cocomadigital.com-anshu-new\public\Images\service\cocoma-banner.jpg
```

## What I Changed

**Previous attempt:**

```jsx
src = "/Images/service/cocoma-banner.jpg";
```

**New diagnostic test:**

```jsx
src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/Images/service/cocoma-banner.jpg`}
```

This uses React's `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable which ensures the correct path.

## Enhanced Console Logging

Now the console will show:

1. **If ERROR:**

   - üî¥ The attempted src path
   - üî¥ Full URL attempted (including domain)
   - üî¥ What PUBLIC_URL value is

2. **If SUCCESS:**
   - ‚úÖ The successful src path
   - ‚úÖ Full working URL

## What to Do NOW

1. **Wait for server to recompile** (should be automatic)
2. **Go to browser**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
4. **Open Console**: `F12` ‚Üí Console tab
5. **Copy and paste ALL the console messages** here

The console messages will tell us:

- What exact URL the browser is trying to load
- What the PUBLIC_URL is set to
- Whether the path is correct or not

## Possible Outcomes

### If PUBLIC_URL works ‚úÖ

Image loads, we'll see "IMAGE LOADED SUCCESSFULLY"
‚Üí Solution: Update all image paths to use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`

### If PUBLIC_URL doesn't work ‚ùå

We'll see what the attempted URL is and can adjust
‚Üí May need to try: `./Images/...` or move images to `src/` folder
