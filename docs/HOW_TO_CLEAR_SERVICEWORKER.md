# üö® URGENT: Clear ServiceWorker from Browser Cache

## Good News!

‚úÖ **Your site IS loading!** The error overlay is just the ServiceWorker issue.

## The Problem

The browser cached the OLD ServiceWorker before we disabled it. We need to manually remove it from the browser.

---

## üéØ STEP-BY-STEP FIX (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open DevTools

- Press **F12** on your keyboard
- DevTools panel will open at the bottom or side

### Step 2: Go to Application Tab

- At the TOP of DevTools, you'll see tabs: Elements, Console, Sources, Network, **Application**
- Click **"Application"** tab

### Step 3: Unregister ServiceWorker

- In the **LEFT sidebar**, look for **"Service Workers"**
- Click it
- You'll see a ServiceWorker entry with:
  - Scope: http://localhost:3000/
  - Source: /sw.js
  - Status: (might say activated, waiting, etc.)
- Click the **"Unregister"** button next to it
- ‚úÖ ServiceWorker is now removed!

### Step 4: Clear Storage

- In the **LEFT sidebar**, click **"Storage"** (under "Application" section)
- You'll see a button: **"Clear site data"**
- Click it
- Confirm if prompted
- ‚úÖ All cached data cleared!

### Step 5: Close Error Overlay

- Look at the main browser page (not DevTools)
- You'll see the red error overlay
- Click the **X** button in the top-right of the error box
- The page content should now be visible

### Step 6: Hard Refresh

- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
- This forces a complete page reload without cache

### Step 7: Check Console

- In DevTools, click the **"Console"** tab
- Look for these messages:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è `ServiceWorker DISABLED temporarily for debugging` ‚Üê Should see this!
  - Either:
    - ‚úÖ `IMAGE LOADED SUCCESSFULLY: /Images/service/cocoma-banner.jpg`
    - OR üî¥ `IMAGE LOAD ERROR: /Images/service/cocoma-banner.jpg`

### Step 8: Check the Page

- Look at the actual webpage
- **Do you see the hero banner image?**
- **Is there a red border?** (means image failed)
- **Or normal image?** (means it worked!)

## üì∏ What to Send Me

Take a screenshot showing:

1. The main page (with or without image)
2. The Console tab with the messages

This will tell me if:

- ServiceWorker is gone ‚úÖ
- Image is loading ‚úÖ or needs more fixes ‚ùå

## Why This Happened

When you first loaded the site, the browser registered the ServiceWorker and cached it. Even though I disabled it in the code, the browser still has the OLD cached version trying to run. Manually unregistering it tells the browser "forget that ServiceWorker completely."

---

## Alternative: Incognito Mode

If the above steps don't work, you can also:

1. Open a **New Incognito/Private window** (Ctrl+Shift+N in Chrome)
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check Console

Incognito mode has no cache, so no old ServiceWorker!
