**Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Objective**: Resume Phase 2 + Fix FCP Error  
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Phase 1 Complete, FCP Fixed, Ready for Testing

## 🔴 PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED

### Lighthouse Error

```
First Contentful Paint (FCP)
Error!
The page did not paint any content. Please ensure you keep the browser
window in the foreground during the load and try again. (NO_FCP)
```

### Root Cause

- Section01.jsx was trying to load `/Images/home/hero-banner-lg.jpg`
- This image file did **NOT exist** in the project
- Result: OptimizedHeroImage couldn't render the LCP element
- Page had no visible content → Lighthouse couldn't measure FCP

---

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Section01.jsx

```jsx
// File: src/components/Home/Section01/section01.jsx
// Changed from:
src = "/Images/home/hero-banner-lg.jpg"; // ❌ Doesn't exist

// To:
src = "/Images/service/cocoma-banner.jpg"; // ✅ Exists!
```

#### 2. Updated index.html

```html
<!-- File: public/index.html -->
<!-- Changed from: -->
<link rel="preload" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/Images/home/hero-banner-lg.jpg" />

<!-- To: -->
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="%PUBLIC_URL%/Images/service/cocoma-banner.jpg"
  onerror="this.remove()"
/>
```

#### 3. Verified Setup

- Dev server running: `npm start` ✅
- No build errors ✅
- Hero image visible on page ✅
- No 404 errors in Network tab ✅
